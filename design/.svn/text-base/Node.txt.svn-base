NODE
----

	* registerQuery()
	
	
	* connectQuery() 
	
		It connects all the RemoteReceiver objects of the query. These are the downstream parts of an 
		inter-node network communication. They connect to their upstream counterparts, opening a socket
		used to channel a stream of tuples. If the upstream node is not available, it waits and retries 
		a certain number of times.
		
	* waitTillReady()
	
		Called after connectQuery(), it checks if all connected RR are actually ready to send data.
		For each of them, it sends a probe in the form of http GET request. When the upstream node 
		receives the GET request it starts sending tuples. At this point, when tuples are 
		
		
		Format of GET probe request:
		
		GET /QUERY_querymem2:0/OPERATOR_FIDmem2 DISSP OPERATOR_memRR1020 QUERY_queryMopK10:QUERY_queryMopK10_1
		
		QUERY_querymem2:0	-> query name
		OPERATOR_FIDmem2	-> operator to connect to
		DISSP				-> token signaling connection from processing node
		OPERATOR_memRR1020	-> operator asking to connect (RR?)
		
		QUERY_queryMopK10:QUERY_queryMopK10_1  -> complete query id (contains query name + subquery?) 
		
		
Status report:
--------------

	Every node periodically reports some metrics about its operational level to the Coordinator, which then
	propagates them to the Oracle. (other nodes too?)
	
	SET_ALIVE: sent to the Oracle. It signals that the node is up and running.
	
	
	LAOD_INFO: sent to the Oracle. It contains info about 
	
		 capacity : number of tuples that processed by the node before overload (...where is it computed?)
		 
		 lastOverload : last time the node performed load shed.
		
		 ot.getLoadStatStr() : number of metrics (...everything should be contained in this function) 
		 
		 	ORFinal
			WSCFinal
			TPCFinal
			droppedFinal
			
			
	REPORT_QUERY_GU: sent to the Oracle by Coordinator. It contains info about the local SIC value. (...should be renamed)
	
	
	REPORT_NODE_GU: sent to the Oracle. It contains info about the average SIC value loacally achieved by the node.
	This is triggered at interval time by the StatisticsManager.
