SUBMITTER

It is in charge of deploy a query submitted by the user. It compiles a query provided in XML format to 
bytecode and starts a query on a set of processing nodes. It also hosts a Coordinator for this query.

- Receives a file containing the list of query files to deploy. It is possible to specify beginning and 
ending indexes to start only a certain range of the queries contained in the list. This is particularly 
useful for large deployments.


- Each query file is compiled to bytecode and a NEW_QUERY message is delivered locally. This message 
contains a string representation of the XML file describing the query and of the operator bytecode 
encoded in Base64. The NEW_QUERY message triggers the creation of a COORDINATOR, which handles the 
deployment of the query.
