	* ASK_NODES
	
		returns the coordinates (ip:port) of N alive nodes and sends a RECEIVE_NODES message to the 
		coordinator node that sent the ASK_NODE request. 
		
		There are several selection policies to return nodes with different characteristics:
		
			- Round-Robin:
				nodes are selected in a round-robin fashion, selecting N nodes starting from the current 
				index, the index is then incremented and wraps around. 
				
			- Least-Loaded:
				nodes are selected so that they are the N least loaded nodes currently in the system. 
				The Oracle has a pretty good idea of this because nodes periodically propagate some 
				metrics about their status, including their current load.
