\section{Overload Reduction}

When the rate of input data exceeds the processing capabilities of a node, the system becomes overloaded
and needs to take action. The rate of input data can vary rapidly, sometimes growing by orders of
magnitude, and the resource provisioning of the system thus quickly becomes inadequate. Scaling the
processing resources is not always feasible or cost effective. In order to overcome an overload
condition, it is possible to employ either \emph{\mbox{load-shedding}} (\ie the deliberate discarding of
a fraction of the input data), or \emph{approximate operators}, which produce a semantically similar
output but with a lower CPU or memory footprint. Next we describe each of these two approaches in turn.

\subsection*{Load-Shedding}

The discarding of a certain amount of input data is referred to as
\emph{load-shedding}~\cite{load-shedding}. The need to shed load comes from the inability of the system
to process all the incoming data tuples in a timely fashion. If the system is not able to sustain the
incoming rate of data with its processing throughput, the internal buffers holding the tuples awaiting
to be processed grow in size, leading to an increased latency of the result tuples and eventually to an
exhaustion of buffer memory. The most important choices that a system faces when overloaded are about (a)
the amount of tuples to discard, (b) where to discard tuples in order to maximise the impact of the
shedding and (c) what tuples to discard.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{Overload Detection} 
In order to detect an overload condition, the system has to continuously monitor its input rate and the
size of its internal buffers. This periodic self-inspection has to be performed frequently enough so that
the system can promptly react to a sudden variation of input rates, while avoiding an excessive overhead
from the monitoring process.

Aurora~\cite{load-shedding} evaluates load based on a calculation that takes into account the
processing cost of operators and their selectivity. It assumes a query network $N$, a set of input
streams $I$ with certain data arrival rates and a processing capacity $C$ for the system that executes
$N$.
Let $N(I)$ denote the load as a fraction of the total capacity $C$ that network $N$ exerts on the
system.
An overload condition is detected when $Load(N(I)) > H \times C$, where $H$ is constant called the
\emph{headroom factor}. The total load calculation is a summation of the individual load
of all network inputs. Each input has an associated \emph{load coefficient}, which represents the number
of CPU cycles required to transfer a single tuple across the entire local operator graph. By observing
the input rates, it is possible to calculate if the current load leads to an overload condition and
trigger the \mbox{load-shedding} mechanism when needed. 
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \subsubsection**{\mbox{load-shedding} Amount}
% When the system detects an overload condition, it first have to estimate what is the percentage of the
% current input that it needs to discard. It has to estimate what is the maximum sustainable throughput
% without an excessive increase in latency and without exhausting all the memory resources.
% 
% In STREAM~\cite{stream} the load of the processing node is constantly monitored by the \emph{StreaMon}
% component.

\subsubsection*{\mbox{Load-Shedding} Location}

After an overload condition has been detected, the system has to choose the location, at which it is best
to discard the input data. In general, it is better to shed tuples before they are processed so that no
CPU cycles are wasted processing data that will be discarded. For some classes of
applications though, it may be better to perform the load-shedding at different locations, as explained
below.

Babcock et al.~\cite{loadshed-babcock} propose random drop operators, carefully inserted along a
query plan, such that the aggregate results degrade gracefully.
If there is no sharing of operators among queries, the optimal solution is to introduce a \mbox{load-shedding}
operator before the first operator in the query path for each query. Introducing load-shedding as early
in the query path as possible reduces the effective input rate for all downstream operators and conforms
to the general query optimization principle of ``pushing selection conditions down''.
In the case of shared streams among queries, the authors provide an algorithm that chooses the location
and the sampling rate of the \mbox{load-shedding} operators in an optimal way.

Tatbul et al.~\cite{loadshed-tatbul2} show that arbitrary tuple-based load-shedding can cause
inconsistencies when windowed aggregation is used. They propose a new operator called \emph{WinDrop}
that discards entire windows. The idea behind this approach is that
placing a tuple-based \mbox{load-shedding} operator before an aggregate does not reduce the load for the
downstream operators because the aggregate still produces tuples at the same rate. Placing the \mbox{load-shedding}
operator after the aggregate, instead, is not effective in reducing the system load, either because all
tuples are still processed and aggregate values are computed just to be discarded. Following this
reasoning, the WinDrop operator is designed to operate on the window of tuples to be sent to the
aggregate operator and discards or forwards this set of tuples as a whole.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection*{\mbox{Load-Shedding} Selection}
Another important aspect of load-shedding is the correct selection of tuples to be discarded. The
simplest approach is to discard the required amount of tuples at random, avoiding a selection step in
the load-shedding algorithm. In contrast, choosing a specific set of tuples according to some
criteria allows the implementation of \emph{semantic shedding strategies} that can improve the quality of
the computed results. Such approaches have been used, for example, in the context of aggregate
queries and streams presenting irregular frequency patterns.
	
Mozafari et al.~\cite{loadshed-mozafari} propose an algorithm for optimal \mbox{load-shedding} for
aggregate queries when queries have different processing costs, different priorities and, importantly,
the users provide their own error functions. \mbox{Load-shedding} is treated as an optimisation problem,
in which users state their needs in term of quality-of-service requirements, \eg the maximum error
tolerated. The system then implements a shedding policy that meets those requirements. If the minimum
quality of the results cannot be achieved for a query with the available resources, all inputs for that
query are discarded, and the freed resources are allocated to the other remaining queries. Using this
approach, the user has to choose among \emph{approximate} and \emph{intermittent} results. The most
demanding queries in terms of processing capacity tend to deliver intermittent results because all their
data is discarded frequently; small lightweight queries tend to deliver approximate results due to
a partial loss of their input data.

Chang et al.~\cite{loadshed-chang} propose an adaptive \mbox{load-shedding} technique based on the
frequency of input tuples. 
In many data stream processing applications, such as web analysis and network monitoring,
where the aim is to mine frequent patterns, a frequent tuple in the data stream can be considered
more significant compared to an infrequent one. 
Based on this observation, frequent tuples are more likely to be selected for processing while
infrequent tuples are more likely to be discarded.
The proposed technique can also support a flexible trade-off between the frequencies of the
selected tuples and the latency defined as the delay between the generation and processing time.
One of the proposed algorithms, in fact, buffers tuples for a certain amount of time so that the
\mbox{load-shedding} decision can be made based on the frequency of tuples over multiple time slots.

\subsubsection*{Distributed \mbox{Load-Shedding}}
In a distributed stream processing system, every node acts as an input provider for its downstream nodes.
The reduction of load at a node thus also reduces the amount of load on all other nodes hosting the
subsequent operators in the query graph. This makes the problem of identifying the correct
\mbox{load-shedding} plan more challenging than in a centralised environment. 

In the Borealis system~\cite{borealis_load_management}, the \mbox{load-shedding} problem is solved using
linear optimisation.
The goal is to maximise the output rate at the query end-points. The system inserts a number of
\mbox{load-shedding} operators and chooses their drop selectivities, the percentage of tuples to be
discarded, so that the total throughput is maximised. The solution of the \mbox{load-shedding} problem is broken down into
four steps: (i) advanced planning; (ii) load monitoring; (iii) plan selection; and
(iv) plan implementation. In the first step, a series of \mbox{load-shedding} plan is computed, one for each
predicted overload condition. Then, during the lifetime of the query, the load is monitored at
each node. When an overload condition is detected, one of the previously computed shedding plans is
selected and implemented at the various nodes, adding the corresponding set of \mbox{load-shedding}
operators. The idea is to prepare the system against all possible overload conditions beforehand and to
modify the query at run-time depending on the expected overload scenario. This general approach has been
implemented in two ways: in a \emph{centralised} and in a \emph{distributed} fashion.

\paragraph{Centralised Coordination.} In the centralised approach, a central server called the
\emph{coordinator} is used to calculate all the \mbox{load-shedding} plans. It uses information obtained from all processing nodes
about the operators they are hosting, their input rates and their selectivities. Based on this
information, it generates a number of \mbox{load-shedding} plans to address various overload scenarios.
Once the plans are generated, they are passed to the processing nodes. The
coordinator then starts monitoring the processing load at each node. If an overload condition is
detected, the coordinator selects the most suitable plan to address it and triggers its execution at the
processing node.

\paragraph{Distributed Coordination.} In the distributed approach, the four \mbox{load-shedding} steps
are performed cooperatively by all the processing nodes, without the help of a centralised coordinator. All nodes
communicate with their neighbours and propagate information about their input rates and processing
capabilities. Each node identifies a feasible input load for itself and all its downstream neighbours.
This information is used to compute a \emph{Feasibility Input Table (FIT)}, a table containing
the input rate combinations that are feasible (\ie not causing overload) for that node.
Once a node has calculated its FIT table, it is propagated to its parent nodes. The parent node
aggregates the FITs of all children and eliminates those that are infeasible for itself. The propagation
continues until the input nodes receive the FITs of all their downstream nodes. At this point, when an
overload conditions arises, every node is able to select a \mbox{load-shedding} plan among those
contained in its FIT, reducing the load for itself and all its downstream nodes.

\subsection*{Approximate Operators} 
Overload can also occurs when the total state of all running operators exceeds the available memory. 
In this case, the system has to reduce the memory usage by reducing the state kept by operators. 
In general, the system can try to minimise its memory footprint through a number
of techniques.
For example, it can exploit constraints on streams to reduce state either by letting the user specify
them or by inferring them at run-time. It can also \emph{share state} among operators when they materialise nearly
identical relations.
It can also schedule operators intelligently in order to minimise the length of queues in
memory~\cite{stream-chains}.
While these techniques do not lower the quality of the processing, the memory usage may still exceed the
limits of the systems. In such situations, the internal state of operators can be approximated. In the
case of aggregation and join operators, the state can be reduced by employing sampling techniques, such
as using \emph{histograms}~\cite{histograms}. These are approximations to data sets, achieved by
partitioning the data into subsets, which are in turn summarised by aggregate functions. Every column in the histogram is a compact
representation of one of these subsets. Another summarising technique that can be employed makes use of
wavelet synopses~\cite{wavelets}. For set difference, set intersection and duplicate
elimination operators, Bloom filters can be employed~\cite{bloom}. These are compact set representations
that provide a fast way of testing whether an element is a member of a set. All these techniques trade
memory usage against precision and can greatly help the system overcome or avoid memory-induced overload
conditions.
