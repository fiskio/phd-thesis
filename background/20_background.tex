In recent years, there has been a growing demand for applications capable of processing high-volume data
streams in real-time~\cite{8-reqs}. These stream-based applications include, among others, financial
algorithmic trading~\cite{streambase-algo}, environmental monitoring~\cite{swissexp} and the real-time
processing of social media events~\cite{social-networks}.  
This research work focuses on the issues arising when the amount of input data
exceeds the processing capabilities of the system. In this scenario, it is necessary to employ
techniques that overcome an overload condition and keep delivering results in a timely fashion. 
The system should gracefully degrade the correctness
of the computed results, following the principle that an approximate result is better than no
result at all. 

Many classes of applications do not require perfect results at all times. Examples are
environmental monitoring and social media analysis. These application domains are the most suitable to be operated
under overload as they are able to tolerate a certain degree of approximation in the results. They deal
with large sets of input data that may require an extremely large amount of processing resources,
possibly beyond what is available to the user. In many cases, it is possible to trade the correctness of
results against a reduction of the cost for the processing infrastructure.

Overload is a particular kind of failure because an excessive amount of data can render a
stream processing system unusable. The management of overload can be achieved mainly with two
techniques: \mbox{load-shedding} and approximate operators. \mbox{Load-shedding} is the process of
deliberately discarding a certain percentage of the input data. The correct execution of load-shedding,
(\ie choosing the right set of tuples to be discarded), can have a great impact on the quality of the computed result).
In addition, it is also possible to reduce the complexity of operators, employing approximate versions
that present a similar semantic but pose a significantly lower computational cost.
