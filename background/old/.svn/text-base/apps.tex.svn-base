\section{Applications}
\label{sec:apps}

Before starting the description of the different categories of systems, I will give an overview of stream-based
applications. Traditionally stream processing has been applied to application domains requiring with very low tolerance
of failure. These applications are able to produce meaningful results only when the processing is carried out without
any loss of data or approximation.

Financial algorithmic trading~\cite{streambase-algo} is an example of such an application. Investment banks, trading on the stock market need
to process a great deal of financial events in real-time. Complex algorithms are used to capture the current situation
of the market and give hints on profitable trades exploiting temporary arbitrage conditions. For these applications the
focus is on efficiency: being able to make a trade even a split second before a competitor is the key to achieve maximum
profits. In this scope the necessity of processing all the available information is evident, as a wrong choice based on
approximate data could mean the loss of large amounts of money.

On the other hand, there are some classes of applications which are able to operate correctly even not all the data can
be correctly process~\cite{phi}. In many cases a certain degree of failure in the system is tolerable and does not hinder the application from producing
meaningful results. In particular I am going to focus on two categories of applications which are capable of producing meaningful
results under partial failure: environmental sensing and Internet monitoring.
