  abstract = {With the price of wireless sensor technologies diminishing rapidly
	we can expect large numbers of autonomous sensor networks being deployed
	in the near future. These sensor networks will typically not remain
	isolated but the need of interconnecting them on the network level
	to enable integrated data processing will arise, thus realizing the
	vision of a global "sensor Internet." This requires a flexible middleware
	layer which abstracts from the underlying, heterogeneous sensor network
	technologies and supports fast and simple deployment and addition
	of new platforms, facilitates efficient distributed query processing
	and combination of sensor data, provides support for sensor mobility,
	and enables the dynamic adaption of the system configuration during
	runtime with minimal (zero-programming) effort. This paper describes
	the global sensor networks (GSN) middleware which addresses these
	goals. We present GSN's conceptual model, abstractions, and architecture,
	and demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation through experiments
	with typical high-load application profiles. The GSN implementation
	isvailable from http://gsn.sourceforge.net/.},

  abstract = {In many modern applications, data may take the form of infinite "data
	streams", rather than finite stored data sets. Several aspects of
	data management need to be reconsidered in the presence of data streams,
	offering a new research direction for the database community. In
	this paper we focus primarily on the problem of query processing,
	specifically on how to define and evaluate "continuous queries" over
	data streams. We address semantic issues as well as efficiency concerns.
	Our main contributions are threefold. First, we specify a general
	and flexible architecture for query processing in the presence of
	data streams. Second, we use our basic architecture as a tool to
	clarify alternative semantics and processing techniques for continuous
	queries. The architecture also captures most previous work on continuous
	queries and data streams, as well as related concepts such as triggers
	and materialized views. Finally, we map out research topics in the
	area of query processing over data streams, showing where previous
	work is relevant and describing problems yet to be addressed. Please
	note that this paper was prepared as a ``vision'' contribution. Its
	main goal is to identify in detail what we believe to be an interesting
	new research direction, which also happens to have near-term practical
	relevance.},

	application components to node clusters to achieve high availability
	for partial-fault tolerant (PFT) applications. These applications
	have the characteristic that under partial failures, they can still
	produce useful output though the output quality may be reduced. Thus,
	the primary goal of resource allocation for PFT applications is to
	prevent, delay, or minimize the impact of failures on the application
	output quality. This paper is the first to approach this resource
	allocation problem from a theoretical perspective, and obtains a
	series of results regarding component assignments that provide the
	highest service availability under the constraints imposed by the
	application data flow graph and the hosting clusters. We show that
	(1) even simple versions of this resource allocation problem are
	NP-Hard, (2) a 2-approximate polynomial-time algorithm works for
	tree topologies, and (3) a simple greedy component placement performs
	well in practice for general application topologies. We implement
	a system prototype to study the application availability achieved
	by Zen compared to failure-oblivious placement, replication, and
	Zen+replication. Our experimental results show that three PFT applications
	achieve significant data output quality and availability benefits
	using Zen.},

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Each year across the USA, destructive weather
	events disrupt transportation and commerce, resulting in both loss
	of lives and property. Mitigating the impacts of such severe events
	requires innovative new software tools and cyberinfrastructure through
	which scientists can monitor data for specific severe weather events
	such as thunderstorms and launch focused modeling computations for
	prediction and forecasts of these evolving weather events. Bringing
	about a paradigm shift in meteorology research and education through
	advances in cyberinfrastructure is one of the key research objectives
	of the Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) project,
	a large-scale, interdisciplinary NSF funded project spanning ten
	institutions. In this paper we address the challenges of making cyberinfrastructure
	frameworks responsive to real-time conditions in the physical environment
	driven by the use cases in mesoscale meteorology. The contribution
	of the research is two-fold: on the cyberinfrastructure side, we
	propose a model for bridging between the physical environment and
	e-Science1 workflow systems, specifically through events processing
	systems, and provide a proof of concept implementation of that model
	in the context of the LEAD cyberinfrastructure. On the algorithmic
	side, we propose efficient stream mining algorithms that can be carried
	out on a continuous basis in real time over large volumes of observational
	data.},

  abstract = {Providers such as YouTube offer easy access to multimedia content
	to millions, generating high bandwidth and storage demand on the
	Content Delivery Networks they rely upon. More and more, the diffusion
	of this content happens on online social networks such as Facebook
	and Twitter, where social cascades can be observed when users increasingly
	repost links they have received from others. In this paper we describe
	how geographic information extracted from social cascades can be
	exploited to improve caching of multimedia files in a Content Delivery
	Network. We take advantage of the fact that social cascades can propagate
	in a geographically limited area to discern whether an item is spreading
	locally or globally. This informs cache replacement policies, which
	utilize this information to ensure that content relevant to a cascade
	is kept close to the users who may be interested in it. We validate
	our approach by using a novel dataset which combines social interaction
	data with geographic information: we track social cascades of YouTube
	links over Twitter and build a proof-of-concept geographic model
	of a realistic distributed Content Delivery Network. Our performance
	evaluation shows that we are able to improve cache hits with respect
	to cache policies without geographic and social information.},
