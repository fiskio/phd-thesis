\section{Summary}

This chapter presented a data model for stream processing systems that takes the quality of the
processing into account.
First, we defined basic entities, such as tuples, streams and queries. The need for handling and
quantifying failure led to the introduction of a quality metric called the Source Coverage Ratio
(\sic). The definition of this metric followed the reasoning outlined in a set of assumptions and
considerations, making it applicable to a generic stream processing system supporting any kind of
operators.
After that, there was an introduction of the different classes of queries, namely fan-in and fan-out
queries.
This led to the definition of the \sic metric with a set of equations for its calculation. A few
real-world queries were then used to show how the metric can be used to keep track
of the amount of failure that occurred during processing.
The next chapter describes the design of a stream processing prototype system that implements the
quality-aware query model, thus exploiting the \sic quality metric in practic.
