This chapter will present the theoretical background about the quality-centric data model we havedeveloped to allow a stream processing system to calculate the impact of failure on its running queries.First I will present a set of definition about the basic components of a stream processing system as theyare intended in the scope of this work. Here there will be an explanation about the foundamental conceptsthat will be used to describe the workng of a stream processing system and to derive the \sic metric.Then I will introduce our quality metric, called Source Information Content (SIC). I will first decribewhat goals drove its conception and then I will present a list of assumptions we made about a streamprocessing system employing such a metric and about the characteristics such a metric should have.Next, I will talk about two main families of queries: fan-in and fan-out, providing some example queriesfor each. I will show how it is possible to derive the behaviour of the \sic metric from the previouslystated assumptions, providing some intuitions about the actual metric calculations.Finally I will present a formal description of the Source Information Content metric, providing formulasfor its calculation. I will explain how it is propagated within a query, from source tuples to the finalresults. The chapter will end with a brief exposition on how the \sic metric can provide hints to theusers about the quality of their results and hwo the system can use it to provide a fair allocation ofresources to all queries.
