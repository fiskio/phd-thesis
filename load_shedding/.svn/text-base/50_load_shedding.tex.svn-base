%algorithm + approach implementing it
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Need to discard some input
        \item Random shed Vs Intelligent shedding
        \item The design of an efficient and intelligent shedder
        \item Evaluation of different strategies in different scenarios
        \item ...
\end{enumerate}
\mnote{For this chapter I think it's better to work on it until is over. The time here will be spent mostly measuring performance and writing about it, since I already have a good understanding of the shedding process.}
